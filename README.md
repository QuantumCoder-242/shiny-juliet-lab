# Phonetic Generator

## Overview
This is my final project for CIS-376 and I have created a Phonetic Generator!

Phonetic Generator is a web-based tool designed to convert text into its corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. This application is useful for clear communication, especially in environments where accurate transmission of words is crucial, such as in aviation, military, and customer service communications.

## Features
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Converts text as you type, displaying the NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents.
- **Kebab-Case Output**: Offers an option to display the converted text in kebab-case, enhancing readability.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive web design that adapts to various device screens, ensuring accessibility on mobiles, tablets, and desktops.
- **Clear Functionality**: Includes a clear button to easily reset the input and output fields.

## Usage
1. **Text Input**: Enter the text you wish to convert in the input field.
2. **Toggle Kebab-Case**: Check the "Output in kebab-case" option if you prefer the phonetic output to be displayed in kebab-case.
3. **Clear Output**: Click the "Clear" button to reset both the input and output fields.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the web application.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive elements and converting the text to the phonetic alphabet.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and styling components.
